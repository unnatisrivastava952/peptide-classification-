Peptide Classification Web App - User Manual 🧪
📌 Overview
The Peptide Classification Web App is a machine learning-based tool designed to classify peptides into different antimicrobial categories. It utilizes various feature extraction techniques and trained machine learning models to predict the biological activity of peptide sequences.
The web app is built using Streamlit and supports the classification of peptides based on Amino Acid Composition (AAC), Dipeptide Composition (DPC), and Physicochemical Properties.

🛠️ How to Use
Step 1: Input the Peptide Sequence
    • Enter a peptide sequence using standard one-letter amino acid codes (A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y).
    • Ensure that the sequence is free of invalid characters or spaces.
Step 2: Click "Predict"
    • Click the "Predict" button to start the classification process.
    • The app will process the input sequence using machine learning models.
Step 3: View Classification Results
    • The result will show the predicted antimicrobial category, which could be:
        ◦ Antibacterial
        ◦ Antiviral
        ◦ Antimicrobial
        ◦ Antifungal
    • Additional details, such as prediction confidence scores, may also be displayed.

📊 Model Details
The classification is performed using trained machine learning models. Below are some key details:
1️⃣ Machine Learning Models Used
    • Logistic Regression
    • Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    • K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2️⃣ Feature Extraction Techniques
    • Amino Acid Composition (AAC): Represents the frequency of each amino acid in the sequence.
    • Dipeptide Composition (DPC): Considers the frequency of amino acid pairs in the sequence.
    • Physicochemical Properties: Includes hydrophobicity, charge, and other chemical attributes.
3️⃣ Model Performance Evaluation
    • The models have been trained and validated on a dataset of 5,274 peptide sequences.
    • The accuracy of the models was measured using cross-validation techniques.
